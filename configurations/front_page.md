### Welcome to WebViz-4D for the Grane field

WebViz-4D is built on webviz-subsurface, but has been customized to only display maps showing timelapse differences.

In this setup we have configured four menu options:

- Observed and simulated attribute maps
- Table with oil production volumes in 4D intervals
- Table with injected gas volumes in 4D intervals
- Table with injected water volumes in 4D intervals

#### How to launch this application
- Log on to an RGS node in Stavanger
- Execute the following commands in a terminal window:
    - cd <folder>/webviz-4d
    - ./launch_webviz_4d config_template.yaml
